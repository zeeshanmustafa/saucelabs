# 🧪 Playwright Test Suite – SauceDemo

This repository contains an **automated end-to-end test suite** for [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) using **Playwright** with the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern.

The tests validate critical login and inventory behaviors across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) using Playwright’s test runner.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**

   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

---

## ▶️ Running Tests

Run the full test suite (all browsers defined in `playwright.config.ts`):

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run only in **headed mode** (see browser execution):

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

Run a single spec file:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/login.spec.ts
```

Run tests in **UI mode** (debugging):

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

Generate an **HTML report**:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## ✅ Test Coverage

### 🔐 Login Tests (`login.spec.ts`)

* Successful login for valid users (`standard_user`, `problem_user`, `performance_glitch_user`).
* Locked-out user should display correct error.
* Invalid credentials show mismatch error.
* Required field validation for missing username/password.

### 🛒 Inventory Tests (`inventory.spec.ts`)

* Add/remove items updates cart badge and cart contents.
* Sort products by **A→Z** and **Z→A** and validate order.
* Navigate to product details via **name** and **image**, then return to inventory.

---

## 🏗️ Approach

* **Page Object Model (POM):**
  Each page (`LoginPage`, `InventoryPage`, `ProductDetailsPage`) encapsulates selectors and reusable actions to keep tests clean and maintainable.

* **Custom Fixtures:**
  `pom-fixture.ts` wires Playwright fixtures with page objects, enabling easy injection in tests:

  ```ts
  test('example', async ({ loginPage }) => {
    await loginPage.login('standard_user', 'secret_sauce');
  });
  ```

* **Cross-Browser Coverage:**
  Config includes `chromium`, `firefox`, and `webkit` (Edge) to ensure compatibility.

* **Scalability:**
  Tests are modular, easy to extend for more user types, cart actions, or sorting filters.

## 📸 Attachments

For bug reports or test evidence, screenshots can be added manually or generated by Playwright’s built-in trace/screenshot tools:

```bash
npx playwright test --trace on
```
